# Junior Research Challenge

The following tasks are designed to test your software development abilities as well as your problem solving skills. The excercise reflect common scenarios that you would encounter as visualization researcher, PhD student or web developer in our team.

Please implement and answer as much of these exercises as you can within 72 hours of receiving them and send us an email when you have deposited the results in your GitHub repository (see Task 1). Contact marc.streit@jku.at if you have any questions about the exercises. 

Note that even if you cannot implement everything that we are asking for within the time limit, you can still convince us that you are the right person for our team by taking a well-structured approach to the problems. Having said that, we do expect you to demonstrate strong software development skills in your solutions to these exercises.

## Task 1
_Goal: Demonstrate your ability to work with common collaboration tools for software development._

Create a public GitHub repository to share any code and documents that you will be writing for the tasks below.

## Task 2
_Goal: Demonstrate your ability to design and write web-based applications._

Create a browser-based JavaScript tool for interactive visualization of mutations in cancer. Your tool will retrieve data from an API provided by the Data Coordination Center of the International Cancer Genomics Consortium (http://dcc.icgc.org).

### Annotation
The following interaction techniques could not be implemented due to lack of time:
- Adding functionality to the buttons of the bar chart in terms of sorting the x-axis label in a chronological order/descending order.
- Using e.g. a an Ideogram in order to display chromosomes OR using a stacked bar chart instead of a "normal" bar chart to display the related chromosome types of the Type Overview (left bar chart) in the Chromosome Overview (right bar chart) chart.
- Adding tooltips in order to show values.

## Task 3

_Goal: Demonstrate your ability to design a novel visualization._

Tabular data plays an important role in many different fields, such as biology or computer science. During a project, however, a single table can change over time. Changes can concern:
- the structure of the table, where rows and/or columns are added and removed,
- the content of the table (i.e., the values stored in the cells), and 
- the order of the rows and columns. 

### Additional Considerations
- The table can be either homogeneous (where all columns have the same semantics and data type) or heterogeneous (containing columns with different semantics and data type).
- The table can be large with thousands of rows and columns.
- The table can contain many more columns than rows or vice versa.


## Retrieving information
The implementation can be retrieved from https://jrc-201904.herokuapp.com/ (in progress).
